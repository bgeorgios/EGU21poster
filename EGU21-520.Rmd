# Introduction

High density observation networks still remain scarce, and thus interpolation is not able to adequately capture the spatial distribution of precipitation. On the contrary, re-analysis precipitation data sets with high spatio-temporal resolution become more prevalent. It thus seems tempting to incorporate re-analysis information to the real-time flood forecasting process and specifically interpolation itself.\newline
In this study, we blended **$^*$genRE** - **an interpolation approach that takes into account local climatology** - with re-analysis precipitation data from the Irish National Meteorological Service (**MÉRA**). We examined the capability of this technique to produce accurate precipitation fields in the context of the operational **Suir Advanced Flood Forecasting System** (Suir AFFS), a forecasting tool based on **Delft-FEWS**.

# Objectives

Aims of this study included but were not limited to:

1. Comparing MÉRA-enhanced genRE with well-celebrated deterministic and geostatistical techniques,
2. Providing insight about the extent to which genRE can mimic its reference climatology.

# Methods

With the use of hourly precipitation observations from 29 gauges of the **Office of Public Works**, we produced rainfall grids over the Suir River Basin$^{**}$ for two severe storms that struck **Ireland** from 13 December 2013 to 17 February 2014, and 4 December 2015 to 13 January 2016 respectively. The grids were constructed by making use of the following interpolators:

1. genRE with MÉRA as background climatology,
2. Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW),
3. Ordinary Kriging (OK),
4. Regression Kriging (RK).

Afterwards, we assessed the skill of the different interpolation methods by using cross-validation with a leave-one-out approach, while we also examined the climatological consistency of each interpolator with MÉRA - an aspect sought by flood forecasters since the distributed hydrologic model used within the Suir AFFS has been calibrated against MÉRA.

# Results

As shown in Table 1, cross-validation results confirm that genRE performed slightly better in the majority of metrics used, for both rainfall events considered.

df <- df[-1,] # remove first row
row.names(df)<-NULL
pander(df, style = 'rmarkdown')
```

Table 2 shows that genRE outperformed the other interpolators when imitating the climatology of MÉRA.

```{r table-2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
require(pander)
panderOptions('table.split.table', Inf)
set.caption("Table 2: Spearman's correlation between MÉRA grids and interpolation grids.")
my.data <- "
  Event        | IDW  | genRE | OK | RK 
  2013/14      | 0.42 | 0.72 |  0.53| 0.41
  2015/16      | 0.58 | 0.75 |  0.69| 0.58"

df <- read.delim(textConnection(my.data),header=FALSE,sep="|",strip.white=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
names(df) <- unname(as.list(df[1,])) # put headers on
df <- df[-1,] # remove first row
row.names(df)<-NULL
pander(df, style = 'rmarkdown')
```

Our results suggest that genRE might provide a better alternative approach for spatial interpolation than the technique currently employed inside the Suir AFFS i.e. IDW. There is strong evidence that precipitation forcing originating with genRE will subsequently provide more truthful streamflow forecasts.
